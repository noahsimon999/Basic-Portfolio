        <em><p>Innovative Executive specializes in leadership, product design, strategic brand positioning, and sales.</p></em>

        <p>I have experience managing a Delaware C corporation and building shareholder value. My partners included Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati General Council, Lee & Hayes, PLLC Patent Attorneys, Echales, Benjamin & Simkin, LLP Accounting, as well as elite private contractors and Indian software engineering teams. From 2008-2016 I grew my company from a community networking app for a college to a platform to connect a small city or non profit doner community. I networked with non profit executives and led marketing campaigns to unite a small city - the City of Austin, Texas USA. During this time I organized and hosted events and led guerilla marketing teams. My teams published a digital magazine, organized and promoted arist markets, and networked with local community leaders. We designed and tested several prototype systems and had begun development of a mobile app when funding was cut off and the company was forced to shut down operations. I also filed a patent with the USPTO that was several years into the application process. We secured a US trademark for our logo.</p>

        <p>In Chicago, I have gained sales experience operating a small startup company called Happy Lucky Winner; running ads and driving eCommerce sales with Shopify; and working inside sales at Groupon on the sales team. Now I am taking a web development course at Northwestern University and searching for employment as a web developer.</p>

        <p>For fun I enjoy all the normal things like going out with friends, eating good food, and spending time with my family. I specialize in woodworking. In my free time I listen to music, watch documentaries and tv shows, and play strategy games. I also enjoy pursuing international relations and geostrategy; the great game as it's called. I have studied world history for 12 years with an emphasis on conflict and technology. I would consider myself up to date on geopolitics and can comfortably talk about global events and trends. I especially enjoy talking about technology and discovery. In general, I would describe myself as innovative, pragmatic, and friendly.</p>

        <p>Some of my skills include: Facebook, Instagram, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Outlook, Adobe
        Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Fireworks, AutoCAD Mechanical, Autodesk Architectural, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, WordPress, Beginner
        Spanish, Beginner Hebrew, Beginner Korean, Public Speaking </p>
